**Sharing my work**

I would like to share my work either through a blogdown or maybe on a public site like medium because they are lest costly and easier to 
use.

**Brief discussion on websites visited and portfolio's explored**

I explored how to create a blogdown website in R and also how create a post on medium.

I found this website [link to blogdown website](https://www.storybench.org/how-to-build-a-website-with-blogdown-in-r/) that provides
sufficient information needed to create and have a working website and i liked the fact that it comes with diagrams that show
examples of how to carry out each step.

[link posting on medium](https://bettermarketing.pub/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-writing-on-medium-cfcf29dfe256).This 
site did a good job at guiding me on how to create my first post on medium and even gave tips and suggestions on how to engage with the 
online and maybe even make some money while at it. 

Some of the portfolios that i liked were:

. [tanyashapiro](https://www.tanyashapiro.com) - She has worked on some really nice projects and i  learnt a lot and got ideas of how to
use data sience in real world projects that can add value to different industries, organizations and even media.
    
. [Themockup](https://themockup.blog) - I really liked the simple way he demostrates how to do different things in R using different 
R packages making it easy and fun to learn new stuff.

. [desiree](https://desiree.rbind.io) - nice site to learn how to use R in a beautiful anf friendly manner with illustrations.
